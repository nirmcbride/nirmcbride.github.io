## Disclaimer
**Educational and Research Use Only**
This IPTV player web app is developed solely for educational and research purposes. It aggregates and organizes publicly available streaming links sourced from various third-party repositories across the internet for user convenience. The app does not host, distribute, transmit, or provide any streaming content itselfâ€” all links are external and fetched dynamically.

**No Affiliation**
The developers and maintainers of this project are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way connected to the content providers, broadcasters, or streaming services referenced in the app or its exported files (e.g., M3U playlists). We have no control over the content linked to these sources.

**User Responsibility**
Users are solely responsible for verifying that their use of the app and any aggregated streaming links complies with all applicable local, national, and international laws, including but not limited to copyright laws, intellectual property rights, broadcasting regulations, and terms of service from content providers. It is your duty to ensure that accessing or viewing any content is lawful in your jurisdiction. The developers assume no liability for any misuse or illegal activities.

**No Warranty or Guarantee**
- Availability and Quality: Links are compiled from public, third-party sources and may become outdated, unavailable, or modified without notice. We provide no assurances regarding the uptime, streaming quality, safety, or performance of these links.  


- Legality and Safety: While we aim to aggregate only publicly available links, we cannot verify the legality or security of every source. Users access these at their own risk, and the app includes no malware scanning or content moderation.  


- As-Is Basis: This project is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

**Content Ownership**
All streaming content, media, and intellectual property accessible via the aggregated links remains the exclusive property of its respective owners (e.g., networks, studios, or creators). This app does not claim ownership, distribute, or endorse any content. Any infringement is unintentional and solely the responsibility of the end user.

**Acceptance of Terms**
By accessing, using, or downloading this IPTV player web app, its source code, or any generated files (such as playlists), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this disclaimer. If you do not agree, do not use the app.
